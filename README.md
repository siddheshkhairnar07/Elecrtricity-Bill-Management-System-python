- **Bill Generation:** Automatically calculates the electricity bill based on consumption and applicable rates.
- **Bill Payment:** Facilitates bill payments, allowing users to track their payment history.


## Technologies Used  
- **Python:** Programming language for developing the system.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs to handle customer registration, bill calculation, and history retrieval.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight database for storing customer information and bill records.
- **Tesseract OCR (via pytesseract):** Extracts meter readings from images of electricity meters.
- **Pillow:** Image processing library used to manipulate images before passing them to Tesseract OCR.
## Guidance:
